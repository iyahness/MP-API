*** Important Notice ***

This is not officially supported by Think Ministry, Inc. The intent of this
software is to be an functional application that demonstrates interaction with
the MinistryPlatform API via PHP. Please consult LICENSE.txt for
copyright/warranty information. Questions regarding this software should not be
directed to Think Ministry support.


*** Requirements/Recommendations ***

1. Developed and tested against PHP version 5.3.6. Other versions may or may not
be supported. 2. Must be a current Think Ministry, Inc. Enterprise level
customer with valid API credentials to actually use this.


*** General Purpose ***

These files are included to make utilizing MinistryPlatform's API easier. The
API calls are already built into individual methods. Pass the valid parameters
into the methods, and the API call will be made. It will return (in most cases)
an XML object ready for you to digest on your own.


*** Included Files ***

mp_config.php

This file holds your unique API credentials. It's separate so MP_API can be
updated without overwriting connection strings. If you have any other
parameters you need to store, put them here.

MP_API.php

This class is the primary file you'll be referencing. It contains the actual API
calls, the SOAP connection.. all you need to do is pass the correct parameters.

More information coming soon.
