*** Important Notice ***

These files are not officially supported by Think Ministry, Inc. Please consult LICENSE.txt for copyright and warranty information. Questions regarding this software should *not* be directed to Think Ministry support.


*** Requirements/Recommendations ***

- Requires PHP SOAP module
- Developed and tested against PHP version 5.3.6. Other versions may or may 
not be supported. 
- Must be a current Think Ministry, Inc. Enterprise level customer (or 
developing on their behalf) with valid API credentials to take advantage of this.


*** General Purpose ***

These files are included to make utilizing MinistryPlatform's API easier. The
API calls are already built into individual methods. Pass the valid parameters
into the methods, and the API call will be made. It will return (in most cases)
an XML object ready for you to digest on your own.


*** Included Files ***

mp_config.php

This file holds your unique API credentials. It's separate so MP_API can be
updated without overwriting connection strings. If you have any other
parameters you need to store, put them here.

MP_API.php

This class is the primary file you'll be referencing. It contains the actual API
calls, the SOAP connection.. all you need to do is pass the correct parameters.

Documentation regarding specific API calls is still pending. Refer to the API documentation provided by Think Ministry for parameter/argument specifics.
